Title: Fluid Properties Uncertainty Analysis 
Version: 0.0.4.6
Author: RavenRoad S.A.S
Maintainer: Francesco Giorgetti <fg@ravenroadresource.com>
Description: This package is meant to be a support for the exploration of HC.
    Its use is to charcterize the uncertainty of fluid properties based on a MonteCarlo
    simulation. Given API and GOR ranges, together with reservoir pressure and temperature,
    it calculates derived properties such as Bo, saturation pressures and viscosity and their
    uncertainty ranges. 
    The package relies on *Prosper (C)* to run the calculations.
